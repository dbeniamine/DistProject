        \section*{Introduction}
        As part of our Distributed Network class, we had to build a network simulator
        tool and use it to implement and experiment with various broadcast protocols.
        In particular we paid much attention to the latency and throughput offered by
        the considered protocols.

        This report and the source files of the project are both part of our answer to
        the problem. The source files should be globally well documented, but reading
        this report should help the reader to better understand the structure of the
        program.\\

        \noindent\textbf{Structure of the report:} In the first section we present the
        architecture and functionalities of our simulator. We also present the results
        of some tests that we performed to check the behaviour of the system using the
        broadcast protocols seen in class (Basic, Tree and Pipe-line broadcast).

        In the second and third sections we present two regular total-order broadcast
        protocols. The first one achieves a good latency (time for a broadcast to be
        achieved with only one process sending), and the second one has a good
        throughput when all process are sending at the same time. We also give a
        detailed theoretical analysis of the two protocols.

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \section{The network simulator}
        In this section we describe the architecture of the network simulator that we
        programmed using the C programming language. The simulator follows a round
        based approach and makes use of only one thread, as was part of its
        specification.

        \subsection{Basic principle and usage}
        Before diving into a detailed description of the architecture of the program,
        we will start by giving some hints on how to use the simulator, and also try
        to provide some intuition to the reader on its basic working principles.

        Let us first outline some useful terminology that we will use throughout this
        report. In our simulator, a single machine capable of sending a message to
        other machines will be called a \textit{process}, a \textit{node}, or simply
        a \textit{machine}. The term \textit{external event} will refer to any action
        taken by the user of the simulator. For example, at some point the user might
        decide that a node should initiate a broadcast. This information will be
        passed using an external event.

        Before being able to use the simulator, the user should first compile it. A
        \textit{makefile} is provided in the source directory \textit{src/}. It is
        considered that the user is runing a \textit{POSIX}-friendly operating system
        and that the regular building tools are present on his machine (\textit{gcc},
        \textit{make},...).
        \begin{lstlisting}
        > cd src/
        > make
        \end{lstlisting}

        Once the program has been (successfully) compiled, an executable file should
        have appeared in the source directory. The program contains a ``help'' section
        which can be accessed in a standard manner.
        \begin{lstlisting}
        > ./Broadcast -h
        Usage: ../src/Broadcast [-N n][-R n][-h][-b|t|i|p]
        Possible arguments:
        -N n	Specify a number of nodes n, default is 4.
        -R n	Specify a number of rounds n, default is 20.
        -h	Display this help message.
        Selection of broadcast mode:
        -i	IP broadcast (default).
        -b	Basic broadcast.
        -t	Tree broadcast.
        -p	Pipeline broadcast.
        -L	Total order broadcast with good latency.
        -T	Total order broadcast with good throughput.
        \end{lstlisting}

        The behaviour of the program can be changed using the command line arguments
        as hinted by the ``help'' section content. In particular, the number of nodes
        used during the simulation can be set. Also the number of rounds to run can be
        set, and if it is set to $0$ the system will run forever.

        The broadcast protocol that is going to be used can be selected as well from
        the command line. The available options are the following.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item IP broadcast: use multicast.
            \item Basic broadcast: the broadcaster sends to every other node in turn
                (one per round).
            \item Pipeline broadcast: the broadcaster sends the message to its neighbour
                which sends it to its neighbour and so on.
            \item Total order broadcast with good latency (see section
                \ref{sec:latencyTO}).
            \item Total order broadcast with good throughput (see section
                \ref{sec:throughputTO}).
        \end{itemize}

        Once the program is run, the simulation starts right away. At each turn, the
        user will be prompted to enter external events for the system. Any number of
        external event can be entered at the begining of each round. External read on
        the standard input (on by line). And when the user is done sending events, he
        simply types ``start'' for the simulator to do a round. The format for the
        external events is
        \begin{lstlisting}
        id event
        \end{lstlisting}
        where ``id'' is an integer (between 0 and the number of nodes) which is the identifier of the node to which the
        event is destined. ``event'' is the content of the event passed to the
        node which can be an
        arbitrary string (with no line break).
        % TODO Give the events that are built-in

        \subsection{Architecture of the system}
        In order to better understand how the source code is organized, we give a
        brief description of the content of every source file.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{List.h} define the structure List used by
                \textit{Fifo.$<$c/h$>$} and
                \textit{SortedList.$<$c/h$>$}
            \item \textit{SortedList.h} contains a small library providing sorted list of
                objects. This library can be used by the nodes to store and sort
                their messages.
            \item \textit{SortedList.c} implements the functions defined in
                \textit{SortedList.h}
            \item \textit{Fifo.h} contains a small library providing queues. These are
                used to store pending messages of external events for each process.
                It seems fair for messages (resp. external events) to be sent (resp.
                treated) in the order they arrived in the system (FIFO order: First
                In, First Out).
            \item \textit{Fifo.c} implements the functions defined in \textit{Fifo.h}.
            \item \textit{Message.h} defines what messages (a sender, a receiver and the
                content) and provides functions to initialize, delete and copy
                messages.
            \item \textit{Message.c} implements the functions defined in
                \textit{Message.h}.
            \item \textit{Broadcast.h} contains a definition of the different broadcast
                protocols.
            \item \textit{Broadcast.c} implements all the different broadcast protocols.
            \item \textit{Simulator.h} defines the core functions and data structures
                of the simulator accessible by the nodes or the main function. In particular the function \textit{LaunchSimulation}
                is the core function of the simulator and contains the main loop which
                will do the rounds, read external events and apply the broadcast
                policies defined in \textit{Broadcast.h}.
            \item \textit{Simulator.c} defines the internal structure of the
                simulator and implements the functions defined in
                \textit{Simulator.h}.
            \item \textit{Main.c} contains the main function of the program. It takes
                care of the command line arguments, initialize the system and call
                the \textit{LaunchSimulation} function.
        \end{itemize}
        % TODO Explain how node functions work and detail what LaunchSimulation does
        \subsection{How to write a program using the simulator}
        Writing a node using our simulator is quite easy, you just have to 
        include the file Simulator.h and write a function :\\
        \textit{void myProtocol(int id, Message m)}

        This function will be run by each node at each round of the execution.\\
        id is the unique identifier of the Node, and m is either NULL or the
        message received by the node id at the beginning of the round.\\
        A node can interact with the systems using the functions defined in
        \textit{Simulator.h} and \textit{Message.h}. For instance to get an external event
        (if there is any) one can use the function \textit{readExternalEvents},
        nodes can also send messages to the others and get the total number of
        nodes in the system. Least but not last, if your nodes needs some
        persistent data, you just have to define a data structure like this:\\
        \begin{verbatim}
        typedef struct _NodesData{
                int clock;
                SortedList pending;
         }*NodesData;
        \end{verbatim}
        During the first round, you will have to tell the simulator that you
        have some data to store for your nodes using the function \textit{void *setData(int id,
        void *data)}.Than you can retrieve these data at anytime using the function
        \textit{void *getData(int id)}.

        Once your protocol is ready, the only thing you have to do is to create
        a Main and call the function \textit{initSystem(int nb\_nodes, int
        nb\_rounds, NodesFct fun)}, then you can finally start the simulation
        with \textit{LaunchSimulation()}.

        \label{sec:throughputTO}

        This protocol is based on the pipeline broadcast protocol but as soon as a node
        receives a message, it will add it to a sorted list. A node $p$ can only deliver the
        first message of its list if this message have been acknowledged by the
        successor of $p$ in the pipeline or if $p$ is the last node of the pipeline.
        This acknowledgement system ensure the total order property (see section
        \ref{sec:pipelineack-proof}).

        \end{algorithm}


        \subsection{Theoretical analysis}
        \subsubsection{Proof}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Validity : As there  is no crashes, if a process P broadcast a
                message m, m will be received and put in the pending by every
                process. Either all he process will be able acknowledge immediately m 
                or there will be (at least) a process P' which is waiting for another message's ack.
                As soon as P' will receive an ack for the other message, he will remove it from it's
                pending queue, and at one moment he will be able to ackowledge m. 
                So if P broadcast a message m, he will eventually receive an ack
                for m and deliver it.
            \item No creation : No rules of the algorithm allow a process to
                create a message m without reveiving a broadcast request for m.
            \item Agreement : We have prooved that if P broadcast a message m
                then P will eventually receive an ack for m and deliver m, as
                the pipeline go throuh all the nodes and as a node deliver a
                message as soon as it acknowledge it, if P delivers m every node
                have delivered m.
            \item Total order : When a process p1 receive a message m1 with
                clock clk1, he knows
                that none of the process which are between the sender of m1 and p1
                in the pipeline can start a broadcast with a clock $clk<clk1$
                because we have perfect FIFO links.\\
                But a process p2 which is not in this set of node can start a
                broadcast of m2, with a clock $clk2<clk1$. This process will not send
                any acknowledgment for m1 while he haven't received one for m2.
                At the end of the sending phases of m2, every process will have
                m2 as the head of it's pending queue, and m2 will be acknowledge
                and delivered by every process. Than p2 ill be able to
                acknowledge m1 and finally every process will acknowledged and
                deliver m1. So the total order property is ensured.

        %%%% Some ideas for the protocols

        \section*{Protocol for good latency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Optimized for latency
            \item Bad throughput
            \item Every broadcast go through the same tree
            \item $P_0$ is always the broadcast initiator
            \item $P_0$ is responsible for the order
            \item if $P_i$ want to send a message, he sent it to 0 who do the broadcast
            \item Latency : log(N) + 1 (send to 0)
            \item Throughput : todo
        \end{itemize}
