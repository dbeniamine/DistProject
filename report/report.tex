\subsection*{First protocol}
% TODO
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimized for latency
    \item Bad throughput
    \item Every broadcast go through the same tree
    \item $P_0$ is always the broadcast initiator
    \item $P_0$ is responsible for the order
    \item if $P_i$ want to send a message, he sent it to 0 who do the broadcast
    \item Latency : log(N) + 1 (send to 0)
    \item Throughput : todo
\end{itemize}
